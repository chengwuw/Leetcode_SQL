# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

# 1. WHERE & HAVING
# WHERE >> 1/ filter rows, 2/ works on row's data, not on aggregated data
SELECT * FROM product_t WHERE SellingPrice >= 500;
# HAVING >> works on aggregated data
SELECT AVG(SellingPrice), PurchaseCost, ProductCategory FROM product_t
GROUP BY ProductCategory;
SELECT AVG(SellingPrice), PurchaseCost, ProductCategory FROM product_t
GROUP BY ProductCategory
HAVING PurchaseCost > 100;

# 2. UNION & UNION ALL
# REMOVE DUPLICATES
# COLUMN, DATA TYPE

# 3.IN & EXISTS

# IN: compare all values in the corresponding subuery >> small subquery
# EXISTS: stop as soon as it found a match  >> large subquery
# IN clause can't compare anything with NULL values, but the EXISTS clause can compare everything with NULLs
