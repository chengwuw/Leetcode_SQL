Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+



-------------------------------------------
SOLUTION
-------------------------------------------
** a not in b -- join 查找不在表里的数据


select c.Name as Customers
from customers c
left join orders o
on c.id = o.customerid
where o.customerid is null
