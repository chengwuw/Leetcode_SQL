Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
 

Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

    min(
        round(
            sqrt(POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2))
        ,2)
    ) 
    as shortest
from point_2d p1
join point_2d p2 
where (POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)) != 0
