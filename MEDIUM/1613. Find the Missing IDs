Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.

SOLUTION
-------------------------------------------
-- recursive >> consecutive, 连续 自增表 > with num(n) as ()


with recursive num(n) as (
    select 1 as a
    union all
    select n+1 from num where n<100)

select n as ids
from num
where n not in (select customer_id from Customers) 
and n<=(select max(customer_id) from Customers)

--  with recursive的逻辑
-- 1.首先设置父表，作为基础表
-- 2.再在基础表上，union all。
-- 3.注意循环语句的来源是基础表，然后设置循环语句与基础表之间的关系。
-- 4.n表示column name(也就是基础表有哪些列)
-- 4.注意：select n+1 不是代表输出名“n+1”列的值，而是在num 的 “n”列下，把上一个n值+1
-- 然后放到名字为“n”的列下面
