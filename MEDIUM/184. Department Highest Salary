The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

# window function + null

# inner join > better
select Department, Employee, salary
from 
(
select 
d.Name as Department,
e.Name as Employee,
salary,
dense_rank() over (partition by e.DepartmentId order by salary desc) as rnk
from Employee e 
inner join Department d
on e.DepartmentId = d.Id ) t
where rnk = 1


SELECT t.Department, t.Employee, e.Salary
FROM (
    SELECT e.Id, d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee,
        dense_rank() over (
            partition by e.DepartmentId
            Order by e.Salary desc
        ) as rnk
    FROM Employee e 
    left join Department d 
    on e.DepartmentId = d.id 
    where d.id is not null
) t 
left join Employee e 
on t.Id = e.Id
where rnk = 1



# method 2: join + in 
SELECT
    Department.name AS 'Department',
    Employee.name AS 'Employee',
    Salary
FROM
    Employee
        JOIN
    Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE
    (Employee.DepartmentId , Salary) IN
    (   SELECT
            DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
        FROM
            Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId
	)
