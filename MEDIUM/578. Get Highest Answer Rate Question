Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: id, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

id means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; answer_id is not null when action column is "answer", while is null for "show" and "skip"; q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input:
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| id   | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.
Â 

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number's ratio in show number in the same question.

SOLUTION
-------------------------------------------
# max/min value problem
# this question may be wrong bc there may be tie in the ranking, so we need to return all the max/min value instead of `limit 1`

select question_id as survey_log  
from survey_log
group by question_id
having 
    sum(if(action = 'answer', 1, 0)) 
    / 
    sum(if(action = 'show', 1, 0))
    >= all(
        select 
            sum(if(action = 'answer', 1, 0)) 
            / 
            sum(if(action = 'show', 1, 0)) as rate
        from survey_log
        group by question_id )
limit 1


# method 2 => directly calculate the metrics in the clause of `order by`

select question_id as survey_log
from survey_log
group by question_id
order by sum(if(action = 'answer', 1, 0)) / sum(if(action = 'show', 1, 0)) desc
limit 1
