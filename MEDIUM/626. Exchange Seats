Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

Â 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
Note:

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.







select id, 
    ifnull(
        case 
            when odd = 1 then ld 
            when odd = 0 then lg 
        end
    , student) as student
from (
    select 
        id, student,
        row_number() over (order by id) %2 as odd,
        lag(student ) over(order by id) as lg,
        lead(student ) over(order by id) as ld 
    from seat ) t 



select 
    row_number() over(order by (id + 1 - 2 * power(0, id % 2))) as id,
    student
from 
    seat



select 
    row_number() over(
        order by (case when id % 2 = 0 then id-1 else id+1 end)
    ) as id,
    student
from seat;
