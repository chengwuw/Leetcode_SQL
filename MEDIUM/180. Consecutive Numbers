Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.





# method 1

SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1
inner join 
    Logs l2
on l2.Id - l1.Id = 1
and l1.Num = l2.Num
inner join 
    Logs l3
on l3.Id - l2.Id = 1 
and l2.Num = l3.Num




# method 2
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
from (
    select num, 
        lead(num, 1) over() as num1,
        lead(num, 2) over() as num2
    from logs
) c
where c.num = c.num1 and c.num1 = c.num2;
