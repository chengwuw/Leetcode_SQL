The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.

# how to deal with the null value after left or right join >> 
    * use `inner join` 
    * use where to remove the null values from left and right tables
    * use ifnull value, ifnull(xx, null) == count ifnull


select e2.Name as Name # = ifnull(name, null)
from employee e1 
left join employee e2  # use inner join to remove null
on e1.managerid = e2.id
group by e2.id
having count(ifnull(e2.id, null )) >= 5 # this is to remove null

#select ifnull(e2.Name, null ) as Name
#from employee e1 
#left join employee e2 
#on e1.managerid = e2.id
#where e1.managerid is not null 
#and e2.id is not null 
#group by e2.id
#having count(distinct e1.id) >= 5
