The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

# median - 569


with  cs as (
    select 
    *, sum(frequency) over (order by number) as csum
    , sum(frequency) over (order by number desc) as csum2
    from numbers
)

select 
avg(number) as median
from cs 
where (select sum(frequency)/2 from numbers) <= csum 
and (select sum(frequency)/2 from numbers) <= csum2
