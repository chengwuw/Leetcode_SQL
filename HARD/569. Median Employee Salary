Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |

`median - order by increasing & decreasing+id=id or id-id =1`



select min(a.Id) as Id, a.Company,a.Salary
from (
    select Id,Company,Salary,
    cast(row_number() over (partition by Company order by Salary desc, Id ) as signed) as id1
    , cast(row_number() over (partition by Company order by Salary , Id ) as signed) as id2 
    from Employee 
) a 
where (id1 = id2 or abs(id1-id2) = 1)
group by 2,3
