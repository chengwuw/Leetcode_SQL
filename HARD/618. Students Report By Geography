A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The students' location information are stored in table student as below.
 

| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |
 

Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.
 

For the sample input, the output is:
 

| America | Asia | Europe |
|---------|------|--------|
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    |      |        |
 

Follow-up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, can you write a query to generate the student report?

-- row to column >> case when 
-- 自动补齐 >> row number + group by 
-- similar to 1777

select 
    min(case when continent = 'America' then name end) as America,
    min(case when continent = 'Asia' then name end) as Asia,
    min(case when continent = 'Europe' then name end) as Europe
from 
(
    select *, row_number() over (partition by continent order by name) rk 
    from student
) t
group by rk
