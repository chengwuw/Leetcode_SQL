Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.

** 组内取较小/大 ==> filter the larger/smaller values

-- method #1
delete p1 from person p1, person p2
where p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id


# method #2
delete from person p1
where p1.id > some (
    select t.id from (
        select distinct p2.id from person p2 where p1.email = p2.email
        ) t
    )
