You can’t use window functions in WHERE, because the logical order of operations in an SQL query is completely different from the SQL syntax. 

The LOGICAL ORDER OF OPERATIONS IN SQL is:

FROM, JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
aggregate functions
HAVING
window functions
SELECT
DISTINCT
UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
ORDER BY
OFFSET
LIMIT/FETCH/TOP

This means that the filters in a WHERE clause are processed before window functions. 
At the time the WHERE clause is processed, the window functions would not have been computed yet. 
And if they are not yet computed, you can’t refer to them in WHERE.

This order of operations implies that you can only use window functions in SELECT and ORDER BY. 
That is, window functions are not accessible in WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING clauses. 
For this reason, you cannot use any of these functions in WHERE: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), LAG(), or NTILE().
